# Portfolio

A portfolio of apps and websites that I have coded, for your viewing pleasure. Includes projects I have coded individually, as well as a travel information site which I contributed to along with Andrew Hanson, Aaron Gonzalez, Ivana Langerova and Reggie Battle.

Technologies used to make this app are HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.
